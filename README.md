# overparameterization-in-neural-nets

Final project on the paper ``Towards understanding the role of over-parametrization in generalization of neural networks'' by Behnam Neyshabur, Zhiyuan Li, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Yann LeCun, and Nathan Srebro.

Code will (hopefully) be restored soon, but for now you can read through my report for a description of the experiments and reproductions I ran.
